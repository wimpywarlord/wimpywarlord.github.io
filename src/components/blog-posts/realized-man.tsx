        My father served the nation for close to 37 years. While this service
        earned him a lot many of things â€” it does come at a price.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Price of a son not knowing his father.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        For roughly 16 years of my life I barely understood my father (to both
        of our faults).
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        I saw him as someone who showed up during summer holidays and gave a lot
        of lectures.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Things he was trying to tell me, I just wasn't ready for them.

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        At 16 years of age life presented me with an opportunity to live with
        him. Just him and me.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        We lived like two men are expected to live. We had 1 mattress- 1 TV and
        1 lonely table in a big house.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Not once did we feel like we were missing something.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        We lived like broke bachelors, but our conversations were rich.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Rich in temper.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Rich in banter.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Rich in laughter.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        Rich in wisdom.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        A 16 year of lost teenager found solace in those conversations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        He taught me how to think bigger than one self.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        How to observe one self.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        He danced the subtle dance of a young mans silent anguish.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        He has taught me countless many things.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed my-4 sm:my-6">
        but most of all he taught me how to be a REALIZED MAN.
